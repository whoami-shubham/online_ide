# online IDE

    This IDE Would work in any linux distribution.Due to cool features
    of linux deploying this is fairly easy you just need to familar with
    basic linux commands. for text editor i have used ace editor library.
    This IDE support almost all frequently used  programming language.
    if you want to add any language that is not present in this code
    then you just need to install interpreter or compiler of that
    language and make new file for that and copy code from already
    present any of file like c.php or cpp.php  and you have to only
    change compile command and run command and file extension inside 
     that file.
